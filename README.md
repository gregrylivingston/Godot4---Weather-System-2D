Godot4 Weather System 2D includes a variety of tools to help create cool weather effects quickly.
Originally used to create a basic anime short over a few days.

1. The SkySetting Node provides a handful of variables to make it easy to quickly create a dynamic sky:
	- Set amount of rain.
	- Set amount of clouds.
	- Set change in cloud or rain amount over time.
	- Control the decent rate of the sun
	
2. Edit the gradient in the Sky TextureRect to edit your sky background colors.

3. Reflective water texture included.
